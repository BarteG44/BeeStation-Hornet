	\n\
	I hope you have settled into your new post well, and have begun your research. \
	Under reccomendation of ______, your outpost has been licensed to research class-X artifacts. \
	We hope you'll appreciate the gesture.\n\
	\n\
	We have shipped you some samples to get you started. The one supplied along with this note should \
	serve as a fine introduction.\n\
	\n\
	To start researching an artifact, note its material. If you examine this one here, you will find \
	it is a **bluespace** artifact, this lets us know which artifact traits are compatible with it. \
	Use your artifact labeler to see what materials a trait is compatible with.\n \
	If you're wearing your science goggles, your proper PPE, you may also notice another, more \
	in-depth material description. This will hint at what traits the artifact has, and can be \
	checked in your labeler.\n \
	Another piece of PPE  you should be wearing is your anti-tactile pinchers, these will stop \
	artifacts from making you a missing persons case. If you are wearing these, and have them \
	enabled, you should be able to 'feel' the artifact, your science goggles will recognize any \
	sensations and inform you which trait they correspond to.\n \
	Finally, don't forget about those dusty machines in the corner. They can be used to measure weight \
	and conductivity, respectively. If you label an artifact then weigh it, it will tell you the \
	weight of the currently labeled traits, and the artifact's total weight. You can use this in \
	combination with your labeler to deduce what other traits the artifact has.\n\
	\n\
	When you're done, be sure to label the artifact and hand it over to cargo, remember to tell them not\
	to touch it. If you've done a good job, we'll be sure to send you back some resources to aid your\
	research.\n\
	\n\
	Good luck, and safe travels."

	How to use the calibrator

	custom_text = "Anomalous Material Calibrator Mk.42\n\
	\n\
	The AMC Mk.42 can be used to stabilize anomalous materials \
	through careful and percise operation. Stabilized materials will \
	not degrade any further, preventing potentially hazardous \
	malfunctions.\n\
	Successfully stabilizing materials will also yield valuable \
	research data.\n\
	\n\
	Operation is very simple, compared to the Mk.41. First, a labeled \
	material must be inserted into the reinforced chasis receptacle. \
	Then the AMC can be activated, to begin calibration. Properly \
	labeled samples will be stabilized, improperly labeled samples \
	will result in-."
